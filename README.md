### Challenges:

- Need element of novelty!!!

## Day 2 - 24/12/2024:
- Started looking into the working or how RAG models work.
- Explored various available LLMs.
- Finalized LLM model to be used - Llama3 from Groq
### Challenges:
  - Wasn't easy to find a free api key for an LLM model.
  - Need to do combine different datasets or create own dataset.
  - Implementing csv dataset with RAG isn't common.
