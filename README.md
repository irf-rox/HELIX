# **_HELIX_** - Healthy Exercise and Lifestyle for Individual eXcellence
## Developer Log

## Day 1 - 23/12/2024:
- Researched about given model suggestions and other models.
- Learnt about RAG (Retrieving Augmented Generation) Model and that it might suit the solution better.
- Learnt about the difference between transformer models and RAG models.
- Explored datasets.
### Challenges:
- Found dataset that is only partially suitable.
- Need element of novelty!!!

## Day 2 - 24/12/2024:
- Started looking into the working or how RAG models work.
- Explored various available LLMs.
- Finalized LLM model to be used - Llama3 from Groq
### Challenges:
  - Wasn't easy to find a free api key for an LLM model.
  - Need to do combine different datasets or create own dataset.
  - Implementing csv dataset with RAG isn't common.

## Day 3 - 25/12/2024:
- Finished the RAG model implementation
- Created a customized dataset which is a markdown file.
- Menu based approach of the application is completed.
- Created a basic website without any styling using flask.
### Challenges:
- The dataset had to refined many times to remove redundant data.
- Took a lot of time to come down to the decision or idea of compiling all csv data into one markdown file.
- Model gave no response what so ever the corrections were made at first.
- Rephrasing the prompt format and query format was quite tiresome.
- Infered that response should'nt be streamed after many number of attempts and debugs.

## ~~Day 4 - 26/12/2024: Exam Preparation~~

## Day 5 - 27/12/2024:
- Started developing the webpage.
- Saw tutorials to create websites with parallax effect.

## Day 6 - 28/12/2024:
- Continued working on the website.
- Completed index page.

## ~~Days 6 to 10 28/12/2024 to 01/01/2025 : College Trip~~

## Day 10 - 01/01/2025:
- Completed the frontend for the whole application.
- Started documentation/report work.
- Searched possible cloud storage for directories.
### Challenges:
- Need more uniqueness/creativity.
- Creating correct directory structure with Google Drive API was quite troublesome.

## Day 11 - 02/01/2025:
- Completed cloud upload of chroma database in google drive.
- Completed documentation.
- Submitted report.
### Challenges:
- Download ordering and file maintaining structure while downloading was tedious.
- Tried to encrypt messages from LLM but seemed unpractical since all were taking place in the server and also splitting and encrypting the large plain text was a tedious task for encrypting fitness plan.
- Covering the entire concepts into a very limited number of slides needed lot of criticism and choosing content to be explained.

## Day 12 - 03/01/2025:
- Corrected the report format and re-sbmitted the mail.
